# Recommended Workflow

# Step 1 - Play!

Feel free to play around with the configuration, **BUT** be sure
you have a backup, or are working on a test system!

You'll find the X-Dedupe system in the "Administration" menu under
"Automation".

# Step 2 - Think of a simple scenario

Ideally you would already have a specific case in mind. Maybe
there's something that you could not get to work with the built-in 
deduplication? Or was always too slow?

# Step 3 - Refine

Can you get the configuration into a status where you feel it's
failsafe? All the manual cases look fine? So go ahead, make a DB backup,
and run it. Let's see what happens.

# Step 4 - Extend

There is this one thing that doesn't get resolved properly? This one 
attribute that you need, in order to identify the candidates 
for being duplicates. You can simply create your own modules, 
see [here](extensibility.md), and it's not even that difficult.
